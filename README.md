### About Me

I’m a 20 year old front-end website developer who’s passionate about building interactive websites and compelling web applications. I spend my time doing that at SFP, where I work as a front-end web developer.

Other than looking at a computer screen, I’m a junior at Purdue University working towards a bachelor’s degree in web programming and design. I find myself enjoying a round of golf, pettings all the dogs I can, watching that new series on Netflix, or designing and building out a new side project of mine.
