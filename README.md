### About Me

I’m a Full-Stack Developer focused on building compelling websites, and innovative web applications. Currently, I am a proud boilermaker working toward my bachelor’s degree in Web Programming and Design at Purdue University.

As a developer at SFP, I have had the opportunity to work along-side web development professionals in notable projects. I value the ideas of hard-work and persistence. These values have aided my career as a developer and have shaped me into the person I am today.

I like to spend my free time adding on to my web stack and chasing my dream of becoming a software engineer. Other than coding, I find myself binge-watching that new series on Netflix, petting all the dogs I can, or scoping out the best burger joint in town.
